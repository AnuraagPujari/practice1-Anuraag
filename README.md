Anuraag Pujari
I am a computer engineer trying to focus on security
I have been coding, working with ciruits, and getting data for a project.
I make sure to protize things that have more impartance, I make sure to keep a good timetable, and I make sure to have different notebooks.




Name: Akash

I tell people that I am a double major in Software Engineering and Data Science. In the past month I have been playing videogames, working on coding projects, and watching sports. I make sure that everything is organized alphabetically and by subject. This way it is much easier to find my work.
